Tokenizer (Input Tokenization): The text is tokenized into smaller units (tokens) that are the input to the model.
Encoder (Contextualization): These tokens are encoded into embeddings that capture their context within the sentence/paragraph.
Decoder (Summarization): The embeddings are then processed by the summarization model to generate a concise summary of the meeting.
