Business Meeting Summary Generator
This project automates the transcription, tokenization, and summarization of audio files from business meetings using machine learning models, specifically leveraging BERT for tokenization and contextual embedding, and BART for summarization.

Features
Audio Transcription: Converts spoken audio from meetings into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
Tokenization and Embedding: Uses BERT tokenizer and model to convert the transcribed text into tokens and generate embeddings for understanding the context.
Text Summarization: Summarizes lengthy transcriptions into concise summaries using the BART summarization model.
